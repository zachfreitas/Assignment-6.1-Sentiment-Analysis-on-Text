## ADS 509: Sentiment

This assignment gives you the opportunity to practice sentiment analysis in two ways. You will revisit your lyrics and Twitter data or use the pulled data provided for you. You will compare the average sentiment of the songs of your two artists, as well as identify the most positive and negative songs. You will also compare sentiment of the followers of the two artists, by looking at the use of emojis by their followers in their descriptions.

### Instructions: 

1. Create a repository under your GitHub account from this template: https://github.com/37chandler/ads-tm-sentiment. Instructions can be found [here](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/creating-a-repository-from-a-template). Make your repository public or add your instructor’s Github account as a [collaborator](https://docs.github.com/en/account-and-profile/setting-up-and-managing-your-github-user-account/managing-access-to-your-personal-repositories/inviting-collaborators-to-a-personal-repository).
